# Comparative Analysis of ANDWI and NDWI for Water Body Detection(2024)
This project explores the comparative effectiveness of two water indices, NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and ANDWI (Automated NDWI), in visualizing and analyzing surface water bodies using Landsat 8/9 Surface Reflectance data. The goal is to demonstrate how ANDWI provides improved accuracy and clarity in water detection, especially in challenging environments (e.g., turbid water, urban edges, mixed pixels), compared to the traditional NDWI.
